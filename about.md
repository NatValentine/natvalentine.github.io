# About

Nat here. I studied game development at uni and am currently pursuing an engineering degree.

Honestly I made this page because I was bored at like 3am but hey! if you're reading this maybe stick around, I'm sure you'll find at least one of my projects worthwhile.

### My interests include (but grow constantly):

*Programming (obviously), particularly games.
*I'm also getting into web dev
*Graphic design (level: noob)
*Art and animation (mostly 2D)
*Music
*Lifting weights
*Olympic archery
*Cats
*Birds
*Sometimes plants
